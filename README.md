Our work related to our Emotion Embedding approach is in the respective branch: https://github.com/arshsinghal6/emotion_tts/tree/EmotionEmbedding. The EmotionSymbol approach builds off
of the EmotionEmbedding work on the: https://github.com/arshsinghal6/emotion_tts/tree/EmotionSymbol branch.

Our work related our second main approach, Emotion Transfer, is on the branch of the same name: https://github.com/arshsinghal6/emotion_tts/tree/EmotionTransfer.
